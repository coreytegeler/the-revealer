<strong><em>The Revealer</em></strong> publishes writing that reflects upon religion as a key point of intersection between beliefs, practices, politi<span class="text_exposed_show">cs, representation, economics, and identity, where the important forces that shape individuals, societies, and their relationship to each other, play out. This can mean pointing a wider lens at the way others in the media cover an issue, or reviewing a book, or doing on-the-ground reporting on a situation. We publish work in many forms, including blog posts, long form reporting, arts and culture reviews, first person narratives, and photography.</span>

The magazine is edited by <strong>Kali Handelman</strong>, who can be reached at editor@therevealer.org.

<em>The Revealer </em>is published by the <strong><a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/crm/" target="_blank">Center for Religion and Media at New York University</a></strong>.

<a name="discussion"></a><strong><span>Discussion Rules and Conditions </span></strong>

Thank you for your interest in our online discussion forum. Our discussion exists to foster discussion on topics that appear on <em>The Revealer</em>, and to permit its members to join with other readers in discussion on topics of your choosing. To ensure a civil forum community, users are required to follow certain rules. These rules, applicable for the Discussion specifically, are in addition to the Terms of Service and Legal Disclaimer for <em>The Revealer</em> which are applicable to your use of the Discussion except to the extent inconsistent with these rules.

<strong>Use Indicates Agreement with These Rules and Accuracy in Registration </strong>

In using the Discussion, you agree to be bound by the following rules and conditions. You further agree that all information you provide in your registration is accurate. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not participate in the Discussion.

<strong>Principles of the Discussion </strong>

<em>The Revealer</em> has always been an invitational forum and never an ideological pulpit; the same holds true for our presence online. Above all, we ask simply that you voice your opinions in a tasteful manner, respecting the many others from around the world who form this online community.

You might want to spend some time following discussions ("lurking") before you participate. Discussions are more rewarding when users post messages relating to the discussion topic and avoid repetitive or excessively lengthy posts. Posts to the Discussion are publicly visible to all visitors; however, registered members may select up to five users whose posts they do not wish to see. Simply add their names to the bottom of your forum preferences screen and their posts will be blocked.

If you ever wish to give us feedback on the magazine, our site in general, or on the Discussion in particular, visit our <a href="http://journalismx.es.its.nyu.edu/about/feedback.htm">feedback page</a>. You can find information on sending letters to the editor of<em>The Revealer</em> <a href="http://journalismx.es.its.nyu.edu/letters.php">here</a>.

<strong>Users Are Legally Responsible and Liable for Posts </strong>

You agree that you are fully responsible and legally liable for the content that you post or made through the use of your name.

<strong>The Right to Move, Edit, or Delete Posts </strong>

<em>The Revealer</em> believes in free expression and active and open debate; we do, however, expect users of the Discussion to follow rules that protect other users and persons from the invasion of their rights and privacy. <em>The Revealer</em> has no obligation to monitor the forums, or any submissions or other materials that you or other third parties transmit or post on the Discussion. <em>The Revealer</em> does, however, have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the Discussion and the materials you transmit or post. Should you violate or allow another person to use your account to violate any of the following rules, The Revealer reserves the right to move, edit, or delete your post or discussion thread:
<ul>
	<li>Posts that are defamatory, libelous, unnecessarily antagonistic, or an invasion of privacy or violation of the rights of another user, person, or party.</li>
	<li>Posts that are obscene, abusive, harassing, threatening, off-topic, unintelligible, or inappropriate, as determined by the moderators of the Discussion.</li>
	<li>Posts that are in violation of copyright, trademark, or intellectual property laws, as determined by the moderators of the Discussion. Simply because material is available on the Internet does not mean it is in the public domain; most materials are protected by law. In addition, simply including attribution does not permit users to post copyrighted materials on the forum; only extremely short excerpts or hyperlinks are generally permitted.</li>
	<li>Posts in violation of local, state, United States or international law.</li>
	<li>Posts promoting, soliciting for, advertising for, referring to, or hyperlinking to commercial products, programs, or services; including contests, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or commercial enterprises. the Discussion is designed for discussion and debate.</li>
	<li>Posts which are submitted repetitively, without any bearing on the discussion topic, or otherwise deliberately disrupting the forums ("spamming").</li>
	<li>Posts which attempt to impersonate or fraudulently represent another user, person, or party.</li>
	<li>Posts which are in a language other than English.</li>
	<li>Posts which include viruses, "Trojan Horses," or any other contaminating or destructive feature that may damage another person's computer.</li>
	<li>Posts which include graphics, audio, movies, JavaScript or programs, or other binary files. The forums are designed to be text-only.</li>
	<li>Posts which are determined, solely under authority of <em>The Revealer</em> and third parties employed or directed by it, to be otherwise objectionable.</li>
</ul>
The Discussion is a privately-held, privately-maintained forum. <em>The Revealer</em> has the right, but not the obligation, to remove any material from the forum which we, at our sole discretion, feel is not appropriate.</li>]]></content:encoded>

The Center for Religion and Media at NYU has received a two-year grant from the <strong>Henry Luce Foundation</strong> for an initiative on <em>Digital Religion: Knowledge, Politics and Practice</em>.  The project studies how religion intertwines with the update of digital/social media in recent unprecedented social and political transformations–in particular but not exclusively in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia–along with the implications of these developments for international relations.  The grant was recommended and approved under the Foundation’s Henry R. Luce initiative on Religion and International Affairs for September 2011–August 2013.

<strong>"In the World</strong>," a special channel at The Revealer, is dedicated to religion and media issues outside (but not out of reach of) the U.S.  The channel is edited by 2012-2013 Luce Research Fellow Natasja Sheriff.  The 2011-2012 Luce research fellow was Nora Connor (read more about Nora <a href="http://therevealer.org/about">here</a>).  Through feature essays, investigative articles, book and media reviews, serial blog posts, and photo series, "In the World" applies The Revealer's established critical eye and analysis to international issues.  Read "In the World" features <a href="http://therevealer.org/chapter/in-the-world-2">here</a> and "World Daily" blog posts <a href="http://therevealer.org/chapter/world-daily">here</a>.

As well, the grant has allowed The Center to plan events that bring together scholars, journalists, policymakers, activists and practitioners through ongoing programming and at two international conferences.  (More information about the 2012 conference <a href="http://www.crmnyu.org/event/religion-in-the-digital/">can be found here</a> and the 2013 conference <a href="http://www.crmnyu.org/event/religion-in-the-digital-age-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>.)

February 14, 2013

<em>Digital Dharma </em>(52 min., 2012, Directed by Dafna Yachin)

When ancient writings of Sanskrit and Tibetan texts vanish during the political turmoil of the 1950s and 1960s, the history of a whole society is in danger of disappearing. Scholar E. Gene Smith devotes the remainder of his life working with Tibetan Lamas and others in rescuing these texts, culminating in a digital archive. Discussion follows screening with Executive Producer Bill Harris; Laura Harrington (Religion Department, Boston University); and Robbie Barnett (Modern Tibet Studies Program, Columbia University).

What role have social media and the internet played in the ongoing political negotiations among conservative Muslims, moderates, and secularists in contemporary Iran? How have these new digital initiatives launched an awareness of cultural activists on the world stage? Simultaneously, such visibility also has put people’s lives in danger, especially in the wake of the 2009 elections. How have these developments led to new forms of digital creativity?

The Arab media representing much of the Muslim world are in the midst of a revolution that will inform questions of the transforming role of religion, war and peace, political and societal reform, and relations between the West and the Arab World. How do Arab journalists see themselves and their mission in this critical time in the evolution of a diverse Arab media landscape? What role does the Arab media play — particularly in a seemingly borderless digital age — in representing a Muslim world regarded with suspicion by the West to that part of the world, and in representing the complex and competing understanding of Islam in Muslim nations.

The documentary <em>Silencing the Song: An Afghan Fallen Star</em> (Havana Marking, 2010) follows Setara Hussainzada after her ill-fated appearance on the popular Tolo TV show <em>Afghan Star</em>, when she scandalized the country by dancing — modestly — and allowing her scarf to drop to her neck, leading to death threats from conservative Muslims. Even in the urban capital of Kabul there is constant harassment, including by the local authorities fully backed by the USA as a counterweight to the misogynist Taliban. Her story, carefully explored in this acclaimed film, embodies longstanding tensions regarding the place of Islam and the presence of women in Afghanistan’s emerging and rapidly expanding public sphere, from television to digital media. This program will screen the film, followed by a panel discussion.

<em>Malcolm X used to tell blacks to put aside their religious differences in order to confront their common oppressor, but lately it's not so clear who that common oppressor is.</em>

<strong>By Kim Pearson</strong>

All of a sudden, it matters tremendously what black Christians all over the world think about sexuality. When the Episcopal Church of the United States of America consecrated openly gay clergyman <a href="http://www.grandforks.com/mld/twincities/news/local/6439897.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Eugene V. Robinson</strong></a> as Bishop of New Hampshire in 2003, African and Caribbean leaders of the Anglican Church led the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3137057.stm" target="_blank"><strong>revolt</strong></a> that has brought the denomination to the brink of a historic split. When, in June 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.sodomylaws.org/lawrence/lawrence.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Lawrence v. Texas</strong></a> that anti-sodomy laws were unconstitutional, social and political conservatives salivated over the prospect that opinion polls showing heightened African-American opposition to gay marriage might cause some black American voters to vote Republican. Republican pollster <a href="http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/okeefe100703.html" target="_blank"><strong>Richard Wirthlin</strong></a> advised his party that the marriage issue could be a "great wedge issue" for Republican candidates in 2004.

If Republicans have their wish, the result could not only be a significant re-alignment of the black voting bloc, which has been overwhelmingly Democratic since the New Deal era, but a fundamental blow to the <a href="http://www.kintera.org/htmlcontent.asp?cid=36906" target="_blank"><strong>progressive black theological tradition</strong></a> that gave rise to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s. In the long run, this may prove to be the most substantial effect of the 2004 election, because that tradition -- epitomized by Martin Luther King, Jr.’s plea that the United States “rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed” in his “<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/Ihaveadream.htm" target="_blank"><strong>I Have a Dream</strong></a>” address -- has been the fundamental challenge to this country’s claim to<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/americanexceptionalism.htm" target="_blank"><strong>moral exceptionalism</strong></a>.

Historically, politicians invoked the Diety in the service of broad secular principles that have come to be known as the United States’ civil religion -- principles embodied in the Jonathan Winthrop “<a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/chi/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps022.shtml" target="_blank"><strong>City on a Hill</strong></a>” sermon that Ronald Reagan, Howard Dean and so many other advocates of American exceptionalism like to invoke. Those principles were probably best articulated by Alexis de Tocqueville in his authoritative but vexing 1835 classic, <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/home.html" target="_blank"><em><strong>Democracy in America</strong></em></a>, and they include a generalized belief in a Judeo-Christian God, individualism, a disdain for elites, the valorization of private property and a preference for de-centralized problem-solving. Slavery and its legacy have always been the blot in that vision: clearly Africans and their descendants were treated in unchristian ways, they were stamped with a stigmatized racial identity; they were treated as property instead of being allowed to accumulate it.

African-descended people differ substantially in their views on homosexuality and gay rights, and much of the disagreement stems from conflicting religious views. The disagreements, which are becoming more vocal, are dividing people who have been allies on many other issues. For example, prominent African Americans such as Coretta Scott King, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), and presidential former hopefuls Al Sharpton and Carole Mosely-Braun have announced support for the <a href="http://www.nbjcoalition.org/" target="_blank"><strong>National Black Justice Coalition</strong></a>, which advocates for gay marriage. But former King aide <a href="http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=380" target="_blank"><strong>Rev.Walter Fauntroy</strong></a> is a spokesman for the <a href="http://www.allianceformarriage.org/site/PageServer" target="_blank"><strong>Alliance for Marriage</strong></a>, a group pushing for a constitutional amendment that would restrict marriage to the union of a man and a woman.

The debate over homosexuality within the black community has unique dimensions and implications, even as many of the discussants on either side echo religious, scientific and political arguments employed by others. While many black churches, clergy and churchgoers hew to the traditional understanding that scripture prohibits homosexual unions, activists on both sides of the debate say that <a href="http://professorkim.blogspot.com/2003_12_14_professorkim_archive.html#107159224766214552">same-sex marriage</a> is not a wedge issue for black voters.

That hasn’t stopped Republican strategists from hoping, of course, and indeed, black conservative evangelicals such as<a href="http://www.wellingtonboone.com/">Bishop Wellington Boone</a> and the <a href="http://www.bondinfo.org/">Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson</a> have been prominently featured in conservative Christian media decrying the same-sex marriage movement as an attempt to hijack the Civil Rights movement.

To be sure, black Christians debate the interpretation of several Scriptural passages traditionally understood to condemn homosexuality, just as other Christians. Harvard Divinity School professor <a href="http://www.hds.harvard.edu/faculty/gomes.html" target="_blank"><strong>Peter Gomes</strong></a>, for example, is among those who defense of gay Christians rests significantly on the contention that these passages have been misinterpreted.

However, for black Christians, the issue is much more than a difference over whether <a href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;passage=Gen.+19&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank"><strong>Gen. 19</strong></a>was about inhospitality, whether <a href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;passage=Lev.+18%3A22+&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank"><strong>Lev. 18:22</strong></a> pertained to temple prostitution, and whether<a href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A26-28&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank"><strong>Romans 1:26-28</strong></a> was about idol worship. It has to do with the difference in the way black Christians approach the meaning and practice of their faith, and whether the tradition of African American liberation theology will continue to privilege what some see as a patriarchal worldview. Those differences are more than an academic exercise, because the critical lens of<a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/003/37.77.html" target="_blank"><strong>liberation theology</strong></a> has informed African American culture and politics for the last 150 years.

Black Christian theology emerged as a response to the white supremacist use of Scripture, along with scientific racism, to justify slavery and colonialism. White supremacist clergy and theologians claimed that blacks were the cursed descendants of Ham, and emphasized Bible passages that appeared to condone slavery. Black Christians developed a Christianity that emphasized the oneness of humanity and God’s intervention on behalf of the oppressed. Instead of Ham, they focused on Moses and David.

While they preached a gospel of individual salvation, getting right with God often carried with it a responsibility to uplift the race through clean living and community service. Since the late 18th century, black churches tried to put their vision into practice by investing heavily in building schools, health care, character education, housing and small business development. Although these efforts often suffered from inadequate resources, discrimination, sabotage and a lack of management expertise, the resources of the institutional black church seeded the Civil Rights Movement and spawned most of its leadership. In other words, there would have been no “I Have a Dream Speech,” and certainly no <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/poorpeoples.html" target="_blank"><strong>Poor People’s March</strong></a>, without the critical lens of the African- American church.

As <a href="http://isbndb.com/d/person/roberts_j_deotis.html" target="_blank"><strong>J. Deotis Roberts</strong></a>, a leading black liberation theologian explains: “I view racism as a symbolic, even paradigmatic form of oppression in this country. All forms of oppression are related. <a href="http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=433" target="_blank"><strong>Rosemary Reuther</strong></a> is correct when she observes what she calls an infrastructure of oppression. <a href="http://www.itc.edu/itc_aca_fac_grant.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Jacqueline Grant</strong></a> is even more precise as she describes the triple oppression of black women in her womanist view of theology. <a href="http://www.nathanielturner.com/jconesblacktheologylib.htm" target="_blank"><strong>James Cone</strong></a> reminded us years ago that in America blackness is a symbol of oppression. It is unlikely that seminaries will be effective in dealing with other forms of oppression until they face their own institutional racism. As a black theologian and educator, I sense the need to focus on racism (of which I am a victim) while standing in solidarity with those who are the object of other forms oppression.

Not every contemporary black religious leader shares Roberts’ perspective. <a href="http://divinity.library.vanderbilt.edu/div/academics/anderson.html" target="_blank"><strong>Victor Anderson</strong></a>of Vanderbilt Divinity School, has noted that <a href="http://www.ayermedia.com/clgs/5/black_church_sexual_ethics.html">many black clergy have what could be considered liberal or progressive views on civil rights, but conservative views on sexual ethics</a>. At the same time, black churches and neighborhoods have long been places where homosexuality itself was frowned upon, but gay community members were tacitly accepted -- as long as they were quiet about their sexual orientation. <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/0-345-45422-7.html" target="_blank"><strong>Mindy T. Fullilove, M.D.</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.minority.unc.edu/institute/2000/spkrbios/RFullilove.html" target="_blank"><strong>Robert E. Fullilove, III, Ed.D.</strong></a> refer to this phenomenon as “the open closet.”

Some theological conservatives, such as popular black Pentecostal pastor <a href="http://admin.starwire.com/partner/Article_Display_Page/0%2C%2CPTID4878|CHID103479|CIID145312%2C00.html">TD Jakes</a>, see both racism and homosexuality as spiritual “brokenness” that can be healed by seeking Christ. As a leader of a mega-church with a multiracial congregation, Jakes is one of several black religious leaders whose services combine much of the form of traditional black services, but whose theology is much more in line with the mainstream evangelical emphasis on individual conversion. Rather than attack institutional racism, they often preach that a proper relationship with God will result in improved material and personal circumstances.

Other theological conservatives on this issue see sexual variance among African-descended people as a manifestation of the social degradation that resulted from slavery, segregation and colonialism. For them, a liberatory response requires that men be in primary positions of leadership, but that the institution of heterosexual marriage be exalted. Further, because they believe that theological and scientific evidence exists that people are neither born gay nor condemned to remain gay, they repose considerable confidence in ex-gay ministries.

For these thinkers, support for glbt rights is not only biblically unsound, it is spiritually, politically and culturally damaging to black people. Not only conservative black Christians, but the <a href="http://www.muhammadspeaks.com/Contents.html" target="_blank"><strong>Nation of Islam</strong></a> shares this <a href="http://www.muhammadspeaks.com/Homosexuality.html" target="_blank"><strong>view</strong></a>, which is partially why, on several occasions, the NOI has endorsed expressed by such Christian Right leaders as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. The NOI has also collaborated with the Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s<a href="http://www.unification.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Unification Church</strong></a>, an organization with substantial<a href="http://www.gorenfeld.net/blog">ties to the religious and political right.</a> (It should be noted that the Muslim Nation of Islam’s theology borrows substantially from <a href="http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/mgpp/lifeintr.asp">Marcus Garvey</a>, a black Christian nationalist who was himself influenced by the<a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5070/" target="_blank"><strong>fundamentalist revival</strong></a> of the 1920s.

However, theological liberals and radicals on this issue see the rejection of glbt people as an extension of the <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.html?wfId=1802518">oppressive logic</a> that was used to demonize black people and justify slavery.

Some of these thinkers agree with arguments made by pro-gay theologians and scholars who contend that the traditional understanding of Biblical condemnations of homosexuality stem from the Hellenistic cultural biases of the early Church fathers, not from the Bible itself. Those who subscribe to this school of thought contend further that this Hellenistic bias, because of its elevation of mind over body and spirit, is incompatible with African Christian expression, which regards mind, body and spirit as equally important.

On the other hand, some liberation theologians agree with conservatives that there are Scripture passages that proscribe homosexual behavior, but they argue that these passages should be discounted in the same way that we discount passages condoning slavery, child sacrifice and Old Testament-era rules about diet and dress. Further, some of these thinkers argue, there is both room for and value in the Christian witness of glbt people. For these people, then, Christian duty compels support for glbt people inside and outside of the Church.

Finally, pro-gay Christians differ from orthodox Christians in their <a href="http://www.lgcm.org.uk/html/keyfind.htm" target="_blank"><strong>understanding</strong></a> of the science of human sexuality. For orthodox Christians, the popular saying that, “God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,” is more than a flippant rejection of the claims of gay rights advocates. In orthodox Christianity, God’s relationship Adam and Eve is a metaphor for God’s plan for human marriage and social relations, as well as for God’s relationship with the Church. It was also understood to be a description of the natural world.

Pro-gay Christians give credence to evidence amassed by respected evolutionary scientists, psychologists and anthropologists that complicate our understanding of what is “natural” in the area of sex and gender. One noted researcher in this area, Stanford University theoretical ecologist
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/roughlab/rough.html" target="_blank"><strong>Joan Roughgarden</strong></a>, has created a sensation by positing that while sexual reproduction requires the union of male and female genes, the packaging that carries the genes, as well as expressions and performance of gender are more diverse than has been previously understood. Roughgarden contends that God may have created not just Adam and Eve, but also Adam/Eve, and Eve/Adam. Thus for pro-gay Christians, the complementarity implied in <a href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;passage=Gen.+1%3A26+-+27&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank"><strong>Gen. 1:26-7</strong></a> is often construed as more metaphorical than literal.

While these debates rage, many African people of faith wonder what to believe. Others, certain of their position, are mystified as to how those who disagree with them can call themselves Christian. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.blackaids.org/" target="_blank"><strong>AIDS is killing young black people</strong></a> at an alarming rate, and<a href="http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=10061&amp;TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>hate crimes against people of color</strong></a> perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered are on the increase. Malcolm X used to advise blacks to put aside their religious differences in order to confront their <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/malcolmxgrassroots.htm" target="_blank"><strong>common oppressor</strong></a>, but the contemporary debate may reflect growing disagreement among blacks about what that common oppressor is. And that is exactly what some conservative hopes for.

&nbsp;

<strong>About "Witnessing Tibet"</strong>

On December 14th, 2012, Rinchen Kyi became the 95th Tibetan to self-immolate in China since 2009. <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/girl-12102012151407.html">She set herself on fire</a> in western China's Qinghai province on December 9, at 8 p.m. local time and died of her injuries. 78 have died from their injuries. Reports of new deaths are emerging from the Tibet with depressing frequency; they occurred almost daily throughout November.

After ignoring the immolations for the first few months, the Chinese authorities have now vowed to investigate them, and to punish people suspected of inciting the protests. According to <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-01/15/c_132104861.htm">Xinhua</a>, “Chinese police said organizing, masterminding and inciting others' self-immolations is a serious crime of intentionally depriving others of their lives…those responsible for the brutal acts will be punished seriously in accordance with the law.”

Reports say that self-immolators have died calling for the return of the Dalai Lama, for freedom of religion, and for preservation of Tibetan culture. The self-immolations have been virtually unreported in the mainstream, international media. The Central Tibetan Administration, pro-Tibet advocacy groups and news portals, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America provide most of the reports on the latest protests.

News of the latest deaths leaves many questions unanswered. Here at The Revealer, we're asking: Why are Tibetans taking their lives in this way? How should we respond? Does Western society misunderstand self-immolation?  Is there a history of self-immolation as protest in Tibetan religion and culture? What does it mean to take one's life in this way, to use the body in protest?

Below, you'll find regular news updates from Tibet, as well as a number of links to information about the self-immolations, news reports, and thoughtful commentary.

The International Campaign for Tibet keeps a full record of all those who have self-immolated. You can find the list and further information about self-immolations in Tibet <a href="http://www.savetibet.org/resource-center/maps-data-fact-sheets/self-immolation-fact-sheet">here</a>.

<em><strong>MONDAY 8TH JULY, 2013</strong></em>

An excerpt from "<strong>Letter from Dharamsala:</strong> <strong>Aflame" </strong>by Jeffrey Bartholet at <em>The New Yorker:
</em>
<blockquote>On January 12th, the day that Tsering Tashi set himself on fire, he didn’t seem particularly troubled. He ate an early breakfast with his wife and his parents in the house they shared in a village near Amchok, a historically Tibetan township in China’s Gansu Province. Then he took the family herd—most of the animals were <i>dzomos, </i>female yak-cow hybrids prized for their milk yield—to frozen grasslands nearby. He was twenty-two years old and an accomplished horseman, and his family was well respected locally. Tashi watched the animals graze for a few hours, then went home around noon, leaving the herd in the care of friends. It was a frigid, overcast day. Tashi told his mother that he wanted to wear a traditional Tibetan cloak, or <i>chuba</i>. “You should wear a nice thick one,” she said. She asked if Tashi would like to join her for lunch, but he said that he needed to get back to work.

Tashi stopped to see his friends and asked if they would look after his animals a little longer. “I have to go into town,” he said. “There’s something I need to do there.” He seemed to be carrying something heavy in the folds of his <i>chuba</i>, but they didn’t ask what it might be.</blockquote>

<em><strong>THURSDAY 30th MAY, 2013</strong></em>

<a href="http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=33500&amp;article=Breaking%3a+Tibet+burns+with+another+self-immolation%2c+Toll+reaches+118">Phayul</a> and <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/burning-05292013114734.html">RFA</a> are reporting that a 31 year old Tibetan man, Tenzin Sherab, self-immolated in Qinghai province on Monday. A monk living in southern India told RFA that he died protesting Chinese policy on Tibet. He is the 118th Tibetan to self-immolate.

A month has passed since the last protests, when two monks from Ngaba in Sichuan province self-immolated on April 24.

<em><strong>WEDNESDAY 27th MARCH, 2013</strong></em>

Weeks passed as March began with no news of self-immolations taking place in Tibet. Instead, the news was dominated by reports of arrests and prison sentences as the Chinese authorities clamped down on Tibetans ahead of the 54th Tibetan National Uprising Day on March 10. Three Tibetans were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 to 15 years on <a href="http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=33116">March 2</a> on charges of "intentional homicide." On March 3, the uncle of self-immolator Dorjee Lhundup was sentenced to 15 months in jail for "illegal activities," including carrying a photo of his dead nephew, according to <a href="http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=33122">Phayul</a>. Five monks were <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/uprising-03102013113033.html">detained</a> as they marked the March 10 anniversary with protests. Popular Tibetan singer, Lo Lo, was <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/jailed-03132013170804.html">imprisoned</a> for up to 6 years on March 12 for his politically charged songs, and a monk who wrote about self-immolations in his book  “<em>Denpai Khalang</em>” (Breath of Truth) was also <a href="http://www.voatibetanenglish.com/content/article/1625490.html">detained</a>. Arrests also took place in neighbouring Nepal, where authorities arrested 11 people for "anti-China activities on March 10 (Nepal's Prime Minister, talking to Wen Jiabao on Chinese State Television in 2009, made clear his zero tolerance on anti-China demonstrations, <a href="http://archives.dawn.com/archives/5237">stating that</a> "“The Nepalese government… believes that Taiwan and Tibet are inalienable parts of the Chinese territory.")

Then the <a href="http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=33215">news</a> came on March 16 of the latest self-immolation. Lobsang Thokmey,  a 28 year old monk at the Kirti Monastery in Eastern Tibet set himself on fire in front of his living quarters at 2.40 p.m. in the afternoon. Kirti Monastery reports that he began running while holding the Tibetan flag, before collapsing to the ground. He died later at a local hospital. His death was followed on March 17 by that of a Tibetan woman, Kunchok Wangmo, a 31 year old mother with an eight-year old daughter. Her husband was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/19/china-accuses-tibetan-self-immolation">arrested</a> following her self-immolation for "<a href="http://www.voatibetanenglish.com/content/article/1623614.html">his refusal to cite internal family feuds as the reason for her self-immolation</a>."

On March 24, another Tibetan woman, <a href="http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/mother-of-4-is-said-to-be-110th-tibetan-to-self-immolate/">Kal Kyi</a>, became the 110th Tibetan to self-immolate. She died in Sichuan Province. Less than 24 hours later, <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/burning-03252013111702.html">Lhamo Kyab</a>, 43, took his life by self-immolation in Gansu province.

<em><strong>THURSDAY 28th FEBRUARY, 2013</strong></em>

Protests by self-immolation have claimed the lives of three more people in eastern Tibet this week. Lhamo Dhondup, a Tibetan man in his twenties, set himself on fire on Sunday 24th February, in front of a monastery in eastern Tibet. He was followed the next day by Tsezung Kyab, 27, who self-immolated in front of the main prayer hall of Gaden Shedrup Choekhorling monastery in eastern Tibet, <a href="http://www.voatibetanenglish.com/content/article/1610187.html">VOA</a> reports. His cousin, Pema Dorjee, passed away at the same location after setting himself on fire on December 8, 2012, according to <a href="http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=33092">Phayul</a>. On Tuesday, a monk at Dhiphu Monastery in eastern Tibet known as Sangdag, self-immolated on a main road in Ngaba district.

Their protests bring the total number of self-immolations in Tibet to 107 since 2009.

<strong><em>SATURDAY 23rd FEBRUARY, 2013</em></strong>

Bard College, Kingston, New York hosted a discussion event, THE FUTURE OF TIBET, featuring <strong>Lobsang Nyandak</strong> (Representative of His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the Americas), <strong>Tendor</strong> (Executive Director, Students for a Free Tibet), <strong>Robert Barnett</strong> (Director, Weatherhead East Asia Institute, Modern Tibet Studies Program, Columbia University), <strong>Robert Thurman</strong> (Tibetan Studies scholar and president of Tibet House US), <strong>Ming Xia</strong>, Professor of Political Science, City University of New York).



&nbsp;

<em><strong>WEDNESDAY 20th FEBRUARY, 2013</strong></em>

Two Tibetan teenagers, Rinchen, 17 and Sonam Dhargyal, 18,  took their own lives through self-immolation today in Ngaba Prefecture, the same day as a worldwide prayer event took place, lead from Dharamsala, to remember Tibetans who were dead or injured after self-immolating.

Here in the US, <strong>NPR's <em>Talk of the Nation</em></strong> featured a discussion about the wave of self-immolations in Tibet. <strong>Michael Biggs</strong>, lecturer in sociology, University of Oxford, <strong>Robert Barnett</strong>, director of the Modern Tibet Studies Program, Columbia University and <strong>Bhuchung Tsering</strong>, vice president for special programs, International Campaign for Tibet, participated in the discussion. In the excerpt below, Robert Barnett responds to a question from host <strong>Neal Conan</strong> on the cause behind the self-immolations. Listen to the full program, and read a transcript, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/02/20/172505911/flames-of-protest-the-history-of-self-immolation?sc=tw&amp;cc=share">here</a>.
<blockquote>"Well there's of course a long history of 60 years of rather troubled rule by China in Tibet in which the Chinese have been really rather aggressive in trying to persuade Tibetans that they are Chinese and a part of China. It hasn't really worked. But the thing that seems to spark this in an area which had been relatively calm for some 30 years was a decision in about 1998 to ban the photographs of the Dalai Lama and quietly to ban worship of him.

This had already been done in western Tibet a few years earlier, but from '98 they began to push this idea, this policy across the eastern areas which had been much more relaxed after the death of Mao and where people had been allowed to practice religion, at least to a considerable extent.

So a very big change there in religious policy, particularly about the Dalai Lama and a number of other issues: nomads being made to settle; language, Tibetan language being gradually withdrawn from schools; very strong controls on information and travel; these kinds of issues as well. But I think the religious question is primary."

<em><strong>THURSDAY 14th FEBRUARY, 2013</strong></em>

As a new year began in the Tibetan calendar, news emerged of two new Tibetan deaths, bringing the total number of self-immolations since 2009 to 100 (<a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/tibetan-protester-who-self-immolated-nepal-dies">some reports</a> say 101). As the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/world/asia/100th-self-immolation-inside-tibet-is-reported.html?_r=0">New York Times reports</a>, "Lobsang Namgyal, 37, formerly of <a title="Times article." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/world/asia/wave-of-tibet-self-immolations-challenges-chinese-rule.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">Kirti Monastery</a>, set fire to himself on Feb. 3 in front of an office of the public security bureau in a county of Sichuan Province and died on the scene, according to Free Tibet, which is based in London." Yesterday, a Tibetan man set himself ablaze in Nepal's capital Katmandu. He died in hospital on Wednesday evening. The man has not yet been identified, according to the <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/tibetan-protester-who-self-immolated-nepal-dies">Associated Press</a>.

<strong>FRIDAY 8TH FEBRUARY, 2013</strong>

News that Chinese authorities have detained 70 Tibetans on charges of inciting others to self-immolate has been making the headlines  in the international press over the last two days. As <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/07/uk-china-tibet-idUKBRE9160CK20130207">Reuters</a> reports: "The latest detentions took place in the northwestern province of Qinghai, where police detained 70 "criminal suspects", 12 of whom were formally arrested, meaning they will be charged, the official Xinhua news agency said."

<a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/china/130207/china-detains-70-tibetans-accused-inciting-self-immo">GlobalPost</a>, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21368478">BBC</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/08/china-cracks-down-tibet-protests">Guardian</a> also reported on the detentions.

&nbsp;

<strong>WEDNESDAY 6th FEBRUARY, 2013</strong>

China Daily newspaper and Chinese state television, CCTV, have officially accused Voice of America of encouraging self-immolations. VOA has <a href="http://www.insidevoa.com/content/voa-rejects-chinese-allegations-on-tibet-self-immolations/1598711.html">rejected</a> the allegations, which emerged as part of a <a href="http://news.cntv.cn/2013/02/05/VIDE1360039142367112.shtml">documentary</a> shown on CCTV on Tuesday, saying the claims are "totally absurd."

<strong>SATURDAY 2nd FEBRUARY, 2013</strong>

The Central Tibetan Administration, Tibet's government-in-exile, today released a <a href="http://tibet.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Whitepaper-Final-PDF.pdf">White Paper</a> outlining the reasons why close to 100 people have self-immolated across Tibet since 2009. The paper points to a 'revolution brewing in Tibet driven by political repression, cultural assimilation, social discrimination, economic marginalisation and environmental destruction."  In short, "China's massive policy failure in Tibet."  In the report,  "Why Tibet is Burning...," the Kashag, or governing Council, repeated its appeal for an end to the self-immolations; but as the immolations continue regardless, the kashag considers it a "sacred duty to support and amplify the aspirations of Tibetan people: the return of His Holiness the Dalai Lama to his homeland and freedom for Tibet."

On the same day, Xinhua published its own take on the self-immolations, reporting the "Truth behind the blaze: how self-immolations affect Tibetans." The <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2013-02/02/c_132147044.htm">article</a> includes interviews and testimonies, apparently with self-immolators who survived and family members of those how didn't, suggesting that some died to escape problems at home, or to earn the prayers of the Dalai Lama. Xinhua regularly denounces the "Dalai Lama clique" and claims that it chooses potential self-immolators based on their education and financial circumstances, although the Dalai Lama has repeatedly called for the self-immolations to stop and insists that he does not encourage such drastic action. Xinhua also points a finger of blame at Voice of America, implying that the news service encourages potential self-immolators.

&nbsp;

<strong>FRIDAY 1st FEBRUARY, 2013</strong>

Following the sentencing of Lorang Konchok and Lorang Tsering, the U.S. State Department spokesperson, Victoria Nuland, today said that the U.S. continues "both publicly and privately to urge the Chinese government at all levels to address policies in Tibet – in Tibetan areas that have created tensions and that threaten the distinct religious, cultural, and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. And we take this opportunity once again to call on the Chinese government to permit Tibetans to express their grievances freely, publicly, peacefully, and without fear of retribution."

<em><strong>THURSDAY 31st JANUARY, 2013</strong></em>

A Chinese court has sentenced Lorang Konchok, 40, to death for inciting others to self-immolate. According to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/world/asia/chinese-court-issues-severe-sentences-in-tibetan-self-immolations.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">New York Times</a>, the death sentence was handed down with a  two year reprieve, meaning he will serve a life sentence in prison. He was also stripped of his "political rights" for life. His nephew, Lorang Tsering, 31, received a ten year prison sentence and loses his political rights for three years, reports <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/china/index.htm">Xinhua</a> News Agency.

A further six Tibetans were sentenced to 3 to 12 years in Gansu province. According to <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-01/31/c_132142496.htm">Xinhua</a>,  Padme Tamdru, Kelsang Gyamuktso, Padma Co, and Lhamo Tamdru were convicted of "intentional homicide" and sentenced to 12, 11, 8, and 7 years in prison. The article goes on to report that the four men "attacked [police] officers and hindered their rescue efforts"   after Togye Rinchen set himself on fire on October 23, 2012. Do Gekyap and Yang Monje received 4 and 3 year prison sentences for "picking quarrels and provoking troubles."

<em><strong>TUESDAY 29th JANUARY, 2013</strong></em>

An excerpt from "<strong>My nephew self-immolated for Tibet," </strong>by Tsering Kyi at <em>The Washington Post</em>
<blockquote>The early morning call from my relatives in Tibet woke me in my Washington, DC apartment.  I heard people crying, and yelling and sounds of protest in the local dialect of my hometown Amchok in eastern Tibet.

“Boys, don’t be sad, be strong, walk this way, walk forward. Om Mani Padme Hum, think of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.” Nobody was speaking to me. Just confusion on the other end of the phone. I knew something terrible had happened.

I dialed other villagers who told me, “Your brother’s lovely son has passed away.”

“What?”

“Your nephew set himself on fire on Amchok street around 2 pm today.”</blockquote>

<em><strong>Sunday 27th January, 2013</strong></em>

A lone monk took to the streets of Sertha, eastern Tibet,  today to stage a solitary protest against Chinese rule. According to Dharamsala-based news portal, <a href="http://www.tibetexpress.net/en/news/tibet/10053-2013-01-27-07-34-15">Tibet Express</a>, 20 year old Phuntsok Jungney threw leaflets in the air and called out slogans before he was arrested by Chinese security forces. <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/protester-01272013181546.html">Radio Free Asia</a> reports that he was severely beaten before he was taken away.

<strong><em>Saturday 26th January, 2013</em></strong>

Two Tibetans were arrested and stood trial in Sichuan province today, accused of inciting two others to self-immolate in March 2012, according to <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20130126-china-tries-two-tibetan-self-immolation-inciters-media">L'Agence France Presse</a> (AFP).   Lorang Konchok, 40, and his nephew Lorang Tsering, 31, of "intentional homicide," according to a statement released by the court. State-run news agency, Xinhua, reports that "Lorang Konchok recorded Jokba's information, took pictures for Jokba with his mobile phone and promised to spread news of the self-immolation deeds overseas as well as convey Jokba's last words to family members," citing prosecutors.

Police also arrested a 27-year old man in Qinghai province, on charges of inciting self-immolation, and a further seven Tibetans in Gansu province, says a report by <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/01/24/china-tibet-arrests-idINDEE90N0GG20130124">Reuters</a>.

<em><strong>Thursday 24th January, 2013</strong></em>

"I pray that my aspirations will be fulfilled. If you are your mother’s son - rise up. Sons of the Land of Snows - rise up. Singers of the Snow Land - rise up. May His Holiness the Dalai Lama live for thousands of aeons. My respect to the white snow lion (symbol of Tibet). My prayers for happiness in Tibet."

These are the words of 17 year old, Jigjey Kyab, written shortly before the poison he swallowed killed him on January 19, reports <a href="http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?article=Teen+Tibetan+dies+before+self-immolation+protest%2C+Leaves+note+for+the+Dalai+Lama’s+return&amp;id=32914">Phayul.com</a> and <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/poison-01232013192823.html">Radio Free Asia</a>. The teenager had apparently intended to self-immolate, but died before he was able to set himself alight. His body was found covered in kerosene, his hands clutching lighters, on a busy street in eastern Tibet. Former political prisoner Llamo Kyab said, ""He had reportedly consumed poison prior to his self-immolation protest to ensure that he didn’t fall into the hands of the Chinese authorities alive.”

<em>Self-immolations in Tibet make the pages of the New Yorker. </em>

An excerpt from "<strong>Fire Extinguishers, Tibet, and Tiananmen Square" </strong>by Evan Osnos at <em>The New Yorker.</em>
<blockquote>"Beijing woke to snow on Sunday morning. We had family in town, so we made a visit to Tiananmen Square, where I discovered that a new feature had been installed. In the most critical parts of China’s sanctum sanctorum, a bright red fire extinguisher has been positioned every ten or twenty meters, in case someone sets him or herself on fire.

By now, it is a safe bet that someone will—though probably not there—and that he or she will be the one-hundredth Tibetan to do so since a campaign of self-immolations began a year ago. Yesterday, China took another step closer to that milestone when a twenty-three-year-old Tibetan, named Kunchok Kyab, set himself ablaze in Bora township, near Labrang monastery, in Gansu province. <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/tibetan-man-dies-after-self-immolation/1588778.html" target="_blank">The Voice of America reports</a> that he is survived by a wife and ten-month-old child. The burnings are a protest against Chinese rule and for the return of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader."</blockquote>

<em><strong>Tuesday 22nd January, 2013</strong></em>

A Tibetan man, Kunchok Kyab, died today after setting himself on fire in Gansu province, near the Bora monastery in Kanlho, according to Radio Free Asia. Kyab was a young father in his twenties--details about his age and family differ in reports posted at <a href="http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=32889&amp;article=Breaking%3a+Tibet+continues+to+burn%2c+98th+self-immolation+in+Tibet">Phayul</a> and <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/burning-01222013130828.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Radio Free Asia</a>). His death comes at the same time as <a href="http://tibet.net/2013/01/22/four-kirti-monastery-monks-sentenced-to-varying-prison-terms/">reports</a> emerge that monks from the Tsodun Kirti monastery in <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/special/TibetanImmolations/Home.html">Ngaba Prefecture</a> have been jailed by the Chinese authorities on suspicion of involvement in recent self-immolations.

As the protests by fire attract increasing international attention, the Chinese government has responded by criminalizing the suicides and prosecuting those associated with self-immolators, as Gillian Wong reports <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/tibet-burns-china-makes-arrests-seizes-tvs">here</a> for the Associated Press.

<strong>Friday 18th January, 2013</strong>

<a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/burning-01182013112106.html">Radio Free Asia</a> reports that a 28 year old man set himself on fire outside a police station in Marthang, Sichuan province at 3.15pm local time. Tsering Phuntsok was a father of two. His body was taken by monks to the family home, where prayers were said for the dead man.

With the death of Tsering Tashi (Tsebhe)  a 22 year old Tibetan man, the brief pause in self-immolations in Tibet comes to an end. According to the <a href="http://tibet.net/2013/01/12/tibetan-youth-dies-in-self-immolation-protest-at-sangchu/">Central Tibetan Administration</a>--the Tibetan government in exile-- and <a href="http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=32825&amp;article=Breaking%3a+Tibetan+youth+sets+self+on+fire%2c+Toll+rises+to+96+in+Tibet">Phayul.com</a>, Tsebhe set himself on fire around 1pm local time in the Sangchu region of Kanlho in eastern Tibet.  (<a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/burn-01122013095415.html">Radio Free Asia</a> reports that the man was 19 years old).

On January 7th, the Dalai Lama called for a investigation into the causes of the self-immolation protests. Speaking to India's NDTV news, “They really find it difficult to explain [these events] to the outside world, and also they put a lot of restriction about this information to their own people,” the Dalai Lama said, according to <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/probe-01072013145302.html">Radio Free Asia</a>.

<strong>The Center for Religion and Media</strong> at New York University is one of ten Centers of Excellence funded by <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/">The Pew Charitable Trusts</a> from 2003–2007. The Center continues with an endowment from NYU to stimulate innovative research and teaching in the interdisciplinary study of religion. The Center seeks to develop interdisciplinary, cross-cultural knowledge of how religious practices and ideas are shaped and spread through a variety of media. It provides a space for scholarly endeavor, a stage for public educational events and an electronic interface with scholars, journalists and the public through its innovative web journal, <em><a href="http://www.wp.nyu.edu/therevealer/" target="_blank">The Revealer: a review of religion and media</a></em>, edited by <strong><a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/therevealer/people/">Kali Handelman</a></strong>. While this project was conceived before September 11, that event and its aftermath have dramatized the need for understanding the spread of religious ideas and practices through a variety of media.

The Center is a joint project of the <a href="http://religiousstudies.fas.nyu.edu/page/home">Religious Studies Program</a> (<strong><a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/crm/people/">Angela Zito</a></strong>, Director) and the <a href="http://www.cmchnyu.org/">Center for Media, Culture, and History</a>, (<strong><a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/crm/people/">Faye Ginsburg</a></strong>, Director).

<strong>Kali Handelman</strong> came to the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/crm/">NYU Center for Religion and Media</a> and <em>The Revealer</em> in July 2013 having spent ten years in New York City studying religion, cultural studies, and media. She received her BA in cultural and media studies from Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts and her MA in religious studies from Columbia University. Along with her formal academic pursuits, she brings with her experience working in visual art and independent publishing. Running throughout her work are interests in literature, visual art, architecture, politics, law, and religion and an investment in exploring what these disciplines and categories have to offer one another. She views religion as a critical nexus for talking about politics, economics, representation, culture, technology, identity, and all of the other forces at work in forming communities and relationships. Kali is committed to continuing the work that <em>The Revealer</em> does to inform and engage readers and encourage conversation not only about religion, but also about what we talk about when we talk about religion. She is also the Manager of Program Development at the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research and has taught at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts at The New School.

In the early '80's, just as the Cultural Revolution was ending, <strong>Angela Zito</strong>, Co-Director of the Center and Publisher of <em>The Revealer,</em> spent three years in Beijing doing historical research on the social and political importance of rituals performed by the emperor. During that time, she also worked as dayside editor for The China Daily, China's English-language newspaper, and then as a "newstaster" for the Reuters' bureau. Zito received her Ph.D. from University of Chicago and now teaches anthropology and history of Chinese religions at NYU, where she directed the Religious Studies Program from 2002-2008. She has worked in very old media: bodies, paper, and stone as the author of Of Body and Brush: Grand Sacrifice as Text/Performance in 18th Century China.  Since founding the Center, she has curated independent Chinese documentary screenings in New York and worked in video for a current project on “Writing in water:  Of calligraphy, cadres, and ways of performing yourself in public in China.” Read her online at <em>The Revealer</em>: “Religion is media." And at her website <a href="http://www.angelazito.com/">http://www.angelazito.com/</a>.

C0-Director <strong>Faye Ginsburg</strong> is the David Kriser Professor of Anthropology at NYU, where she is also the founding Director of the Center for Media, Culture, and History.

She is currently finishing a book entitled Mediating Culture: Indigenous Media in a Digital Age.

Associate Director <strong>Pegi Vail</strong> is an anthropologist, filmmaker, and curator. Her current academic work focuses on the political economy of tourism in the developing world, exploring the role travel stories in print and media have in shaping experience and destination perspectives. Right of Passage, a book based on this research among backpackers in Bolivia, is forthcoming (Duke University Press). Gringo Trails, her documentary-in-progress shot in West Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America looks at the long term impact of travelers and their narratives globally. Prior documentaries include the award-winning, The Dodger’s Sym-phony, broadcast on PBS/WNET and screened in New York and national museums, international festivals, and on Northwest Airlines. Vail teaches on Film and Culture at Columbia University and has previously taught documentary filmmaking through the NYU Department of Anthropology’s Culture and Media Program, on tourist productions in NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, and leads documentary workshops worldwide, most recently in Azerbaijan with the Soros Open Society. Vail is a former Fulbright scholar who serves as guest lecturer for the Columbia Alumni Travel Study Program, National Geographic, and Smithsonian.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-21231" src="http://wp.nyu.edu/therevealer/wp-content/uploads/sites/1730/2015/08/static1.squarespace-1-300x300.jpg" alt="static1.squarespace-1" width="300" height="300" />

The <a href="http://www.magnumfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Magnum Foundation</a> plays an influential role in the global documentary photography community as a grant maker, thought leader, and key collaborator for photographers critically engaged with a range of issues. With strategic partnerships and targeted distribution, we promote creativity, rigor, and diverse voices in the field to seed new models of documentary practice and create possibilities for lasting impact on pressing social issues.

Through this pilot initiative we are seeking to support photographers to partner with other creative practitioners to produce in-depth and experimental projects on religion.

We believe that photographers working in partnership with other creative practitioners will produce uniquely effective and experimental storytelling that will further awareness and understanding. The interdisciplinary storytelling that we hope to support will expand our knowledge of the politically significant and vastly complex ways that religion impacts our lives. It will also produce projects that demonstrate creative new approaches to visual storytelling and collaborative creative work. Selected projects will receive production grants, participate in an innovation laboratory, and receive distribution support.

Each Project team will receive a production grant of up to $18,000.

<b>Proposals are due July 12, 2016. </b>

The Magnum Foundation is working with <a href="http://therevealer.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Revealer: A Review of Religion and Media</a>, NYU’s <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/cmch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Center for Media Culture and History</a>, and <a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/page/933-brown-institute/929" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Brown Institute for Media Innovation</a> at Columbia University's School of Journalism.  Support for this pilot initiative is generously provided by the The Henry Luce Foundation, which seeks to bring important ideas to the center of American life, strengthen international understanding, and foster innovation and leadership in academic, policy, religious, and art communities.

The project development laboratory will take place in New York City on October 20-22. The lab will focus on collaboration and will be an opportunity to connect with our advisory team, experts in the field, and creative technologists for guided project development sessions. Grantees will be required to attend the two-day lab and participants will receive financial support for housing and travel to New York.

<b>PROPOSAL GUIDELINES</b>

In our current environment of increased sectarian conflict, it is more important than ever to provide in-depth, nuanced perspectives on the many roles religion plays in contemporary society.  We are seeking proposals for creative, experimental, and underreported stories. Below are topical frameworks that we suggest you use as guidelines as you develop your proposals:

<b>Religion and Economy</b> - How have the economic crises of the last decade affected religious life and institutional authority within traditions? What effect do wealth and poverty have on religious life and institutions? What assumptions do we make about the religious lives of the poor versus the rich? How does neoliberal thinking in terms of markets, profit, and value influence rhetoric within and about religious communities.

<b>New Religious Movements</b> - What are current attitudes around the occult, paganism, Satanism, Scientology, and other new religious movements? How have they changed? Why is there so much current pop culture interest in witches? What gets called a “cult” and why?  What might be a new way of thinking about and representing traditions and communities often treated with suspicion such as Mormonism or Scientology?

<b>Religion and Climate Change </b>- How are religious communities organizing around environmental issues? What kinds of positions are religious leaders taking and how? What are some of the differences between religious organizing around climate change in wealthier countries versus poorer ones? What effect has Pope Francis’ leadership had on the debate?

<b>Religious Violence</b> - What images come to mind when we think of religious violence? How do terms like “sectarian,” “fanatic,” “martyr,” and “radical” get translated into images? What work do those cliche symbols do? What do images of “victims” look like? What do images of “terrorists” look like? Are certain kinds of violence over or under represented and why?

<b>Religion and Race</b> - How do racial stereotypes intersect with religious ones? What role do religious actors and institutions have in organizing around racial justice movements such as Black Lives Matter? What does it mean to show images of preachers at protests? What credibility does that kind of leadership and participation lend and why? How do religious institutions engage with movements and legal battles?

<b>Indigenous Rights and Religion</b> - How does respect (or lack thereof) for indigenous religious traditions play out in issues of sovereignty, land rights, and cultural preservation? How is indigenous religious life performed or hidden from outsiders and why?

<b>Religion and Tourism</b> - What is the relationship between tourism and pilgrimage? Why do tourists seek out temples and holy sites as destinations? How do tourists relate to these sites? How do commerce and holiness mix in these places? What is the effect of globalization on these places and movement between them? Does religion get “performed” for outsiders and, if so, how?

<b>Religion and Social Movements</b> - How do religious people and institutions participate in political and social movements, for example, Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, the debates over reproductive justice, and immigration policy? What do terms like collectivity, commons, and community mean? What kind of religious history do they have? What role does interfaith organizing have in these movements? What does “interfaith” look like and what hasn’t been shown or could be shown differently?

<b>Religion and Science</b> - Why are images of monks hooked up to MRI machines so compelling? What stereotypes are being confirmed or disrupted with these kinds of images? What about a synagogue that uses twitter or the Pope’s Instagram account? Is there an assumption that religious actors resist technology that sustains and allows for our surprise here? Is there truth to that assumption? What about when religious actors refuse medical care? How are their stories shown? What would a story about prayer in hospitals look like? How might it look different?

<b>Atheism and Agnosticism</b> - What does “a believer” look like? What does a “non-believer” look like? What does a non-religious or anti-religious community look like? What new symbols are being created to represent these communities?

<b>OUR GOALS FOR THIS INITIATIVE ARE TO</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Support storytelling that offers critical insight on religion’s role in contemporary society</li>
 	<li>Encourage exploration of issues and perspectives that are not widely represented or reported in mainstream media</li>
 	<li>Facilitate photographers’ collaboration with practitioners across a range of disciplines (writers and others of a range of genres, designers, data scientists, cartoonists, ethnographers, technologists and others)</li>
 	<li>Facilitate learning about interdisciplinary collaboration and partnership building among creatives</li>
 	<li>Facilitate project teams’ goals for distribution</li>
</ul>
<b>REQUIREMENTS</b>
<ol>
 	<li><b>Written Proposal.  </b>Describe the nature of the project, demonstrate knowledge of geographic region and topical area of focus, and explain why the project should receive support from this particular initiative. You may propose to create new projects or to complete a final chapter of a project that is already underway. If you propose to complete a project that is already underway, please describe the specific scope of the final chapter of this project. In all cases, applicants should plan to complete proposed projects by December 15, 2016. Project proposal must be written in English but the project can be created in any language.</li>
 	<li><b>Type of Project Partner:</b>  Collaboration is required for this initiative. Photographers will work with a wide range of project partners: from writers to radio producers, creative technologists, academics, filmmakers, musicians, and designers. What kind of partner would you like to work with? How will the partnership work? Why is the partnership necessary for the project? What will be the relationship between photography and work produced by the project partner? Partners can come from a range of disciplines, including but not limited to all types of writers, technologists, audio producers, designers, and others. Notes on partnership: If you name a specific proposed partner, please note that your selection will be subject to review by the committee. If you describe a profile of a person you hope to work with, the committee will assist in matching you with a project partner. Both of these options for identifying partners in your proposals will be treated equally by the committee.</li>
</ol>
3. <b>Engagement:</b> Describe your plans to share the work and engage audiences.

4. <b>Travel Expenses:</b> Outline travel costs for your project.

<b>      </b>5. <b>Photography Sample: </b>See below for a full description of requirements.

<b>REVIEW PROCESS</b>

Proposals will be reviewed by an independent editorial committee that will select projects at its sole discretion, based on the goals for this initiative and material submitted by the applicant. The editorial committee’s deliberations will be confidential and will not be subject to further inquiries by applicants. Once selected, a Project Plan outlining the approved project will be agreed upon by the project team and Magnum Foundation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Center for Religion and Media at NYU and The Revealer are very pleased to announce that Dr. Simran Jeet Singh will be our Henry R. Luce Initiative on Religion in International Affairs post-doctoral fellow for the 2017-2018 school year.

Dr. Singh is a prolific and thoughtful scholar, writer, and advocate and we are very much looking forward to working with him next year. Please see below for his complete bio.

Keep an eye our for his writing and events with us come next Fall!

In the meantime, we suggest following him on <a href="https://twitter.com/sikhprof?lang=en" target="_blank">Twitter.</a>
<p style="text-align: center">***</p>
Dr. Simran Jeet Singh is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Religion at Trinity University. He is the Senior Religion Fellow for the Sikh Coalition and a Truman National Security Fellow for the Truman National Security Project. Simran holds graduate degrees from Harvard University and Columbia University, and for the 2017-2018 academic year will be the Henry R. Luce Post-doctoral Fellow of Religion and International Affairs at the NYU Center for Religion and Media.

Simran is a prolific writer who contributes frequently to various news outlets and digital platforms. He has become a consistent expert for reporters and news outlets around the world in television, radio, and print media. Dr. Singh also serves on the board for the Religion Newswriters Association, the premiere organization for religion journalists in the country.

Simran’s academic expertise focuses on the history of religious communities in South Asia, and he has taught at Columbia University and Trinity University on Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, and Sikh traditions. Simran’s recent scholarship and public engagement examines xenophobia, racial profiling and hate violence in post 9/11 America. He is currently working on two books for publication – one explores the intersections of race and religion in modern Islamophobia, and the other historicizes the formation of the Sikh tradition around the earliest memories of its founder, Guru Nanak.

In addition to his academic and media commitments, Simran speaks regularly on a variety of topics related to diversity, inclusion, civil rights, religion, and hate violence. His thought leadership extends to a number of audiences, including educational institutions, religious communities, and public venues like the White House and Pentagon.

Born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, Simran is a diehard Spurs fan and avid marathon runner. He currently lives with his wife and daughter in Manhattan, New York, where his wife, Dr. Gunisha Kaur, teaches and works as an anesthesiologist specializing in global health at Weill Cornell Medical College.

<em>The Revealer </em>is launching a new initiative called <em>Field Notes</em>, an ongoing forum where scholars and journalists can share new work <em>as they do it</em>. We invite anthropologists, sociologists, and textualists (literary and historical), reporters, and photographers to introduce new work in new ways. We want to see notes from your field work sites; a manuscript you discovered deep in the archive; a conversation with a research subject; a methodology question that you want to work through in writing; a side-note that won’t fit in the book but is too good not to share; a piece of the article you loved but your editor nixed; a review of a movie you went to see for a break from work but you realized was related, and more! Consider this a way to process your work while it’s in process. <em>Field Notes </em>will also be a chance to cultivate public writing skills and portfolios. We think that giving scholars an opportunity to share their work in this way will deepen and expand both the research and its reception and hereby invite you to send us your pitches.

Tell us a bit about your work and how you might like to share <em>Field Notes</em> from it by emailing us here: editor@therevealer.org

You can read our published <em>Field Notes </em><a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/therevealer/tag/field-notes/"><strong>here</strong></a>.]]></content:encoded>
